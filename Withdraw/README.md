• Suppose you have an account with 500$ and you will simulate an ATM machine.
• You will take an input from user to determine how much money will be withdrawn.
• If withdraw amount is smaller than the amount on the account, print out the remaining
amount on the account.
• If withdraw amount greater than the amount, you can withdraw untill -500$.
• If you withdraw more than 500$, you will print the amount on the account and charge the
user with (1.7*amount after 0).
• For example, if you withdraw 700$, you will charge the user with (500$-700$=200$,
200$x1.7=340$)
• If you withdraw more than 1000$, you will charge the user with 500$*1.7 and give an
error.
