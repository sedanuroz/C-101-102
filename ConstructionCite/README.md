Suppose there is a school in a neighborhood placed on a x-y coordinate system.
• Around the school, there are constructable places.
• Based on the distance formula we provided below, a construction site should be far away
at least 120 units from the highscool.
• You will take two different locations from user to see that those locations are
constructable or not.
• Formula for the distance is given below;
Distance = (Site(x) − School(x))

2 + (Site(y) − School(y))
2

• You will calculate the distances of the sites and print out the distances to the console and
print out which sites are allowed for construction.
• Location of the school is (-7, 5).
