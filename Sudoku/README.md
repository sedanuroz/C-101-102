For this question, you are asked to write a code that controls a completed sudoku whether
it is solved correctly or not.
• We will provide a completed sudoku (9x9 matrix) that you can work on.
• Rules for the sudoku are:
o Each row must contain the numbers from 1 to 9, without repetitions. (10)
o Each column must contain the numbers from 1 to 9, without repetitions. (10)
o The digits can only occur once per block (3x3). (10)
o The sum of every single row, column and block must be equal to 45. (20)

• After each rule is checked, you must prompt a message.
• If you encounter a problem during rule checking, you should prompt an error message for
each rule-breaking case.
• Please keep in mind that in some cases, sum of a block can be 45 while it does not
contain all numbers between 1-9. That is why you need to check each case invidually.
• Advice: Try to control each rule at different loops. Do not try to check everyting at once.
• You can modify your output based on Figure 3.
