For this question, you are asked to create three different methods. First method takes a
positive integer from user, second method prints Mersenne numbers upto that number and
third methods print Mersenne numbers that are also prime numbers upto that number.
• Mersenne number is a number that is in the form of M(n) = 2
n − 1.

• Method signatures are given below:
o static int getPositiveNumber()
o static void printMersenneNumbers(int number)
o static void printPrimeMersenneNumbers(int number)
• You must use the number that you take from user as your second and third method’s
parameter.
