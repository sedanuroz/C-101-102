For this question, you will calculate the electricity bill based on several conditions.
â€¢ You will take one input from user (electricity unit charge) and calculate the net electricity
bill based on these conditions:
a. If unit consumed less or equal to 50 units. Then net bill = unit * 0.50.
b. If unit consumed more than 50 units but less than 150 units. Then add the first 50
units amount (as we stated in section a). Multiply the remaining amount with 0.75.
i. For example, unit charge is given 75. Bill = 50*0.5 + (75-50)*0.75
c. If unit consumed more than 150 units but less than 250 units. Then add the first 50
units amount (as we stated in section a) and then add amount 150 (as we stated in
section b). Multiply the remaining amount with 1.20.
i. For example, unit charge is given 200. Bill = 50*0.5 + 100*0.75 + (200-
150)*1.20

d. If unit consumed more than 250 units. Then add the first 50 units amount (as we
stated in section a) and add amount 150 (as we stated in section b) and then add
amount 250 (as we stated in section c). Multiply the remaining amount with 1.50.
i. For example, unit charge is given 300. Bill = 50*0.5 + 100*0.75 +
100*1.20 + (300-250)*1.50.

e. After bill charge is calculated, add surcharge to the bill to find the net charge.
Amount for the surcharge is 20%.
i. For example, if bill is found to be 300, net bill = 300 + (300*20/100)
