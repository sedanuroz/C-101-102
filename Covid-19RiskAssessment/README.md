In this exercise, you will make Covid-19 risk assessment of a patient.
• You will take some user inputs in order to make the assessment.
• You can see user inputs in Table 1 as Age, COV19 Symptoms, Test Result and COV19
History.
• Points along with answers indicate the risk point of each answer. In the end, you need to
sum up all those points in order to complete the assessment.
• In the worst case (Age=65+, COV19 Symptoms=Yes, Test Result=Positive, COV19
History=No), final result is 25+25+25+25 = 100.
• Based on your assessment result, you will have different options to act on the patient.
• You must code this part of your program (option part) by creating switch-case conditional
operator.
