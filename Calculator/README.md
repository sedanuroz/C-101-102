In this exercise, you will create a simple calculator. In the beginning, your program will
ask which arithmetic operation which you will perform.
• You will print a menu that shows arithmetic operations.
• You should use switch-case statement for this question.
• User will select an operation, then you will take 2 integers from user to perform the
operation.
• For substraction and division operations, user must give bigger integer as first input.
• If user enters 0 for the divisor, you should print an error.
• Note: You do not have to check if the first input is bigger, just give the bigger integer as
the first input.
