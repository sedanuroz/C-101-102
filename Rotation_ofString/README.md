In this question, you are asked to create a method to check if a string is a rotation of
another string.
• str1 is rotation of str2 if str1 and str2 have the same words in the same order but different
locations.
• Signature of the method is given below:
o static bool IsRotation(string str1, string str2)
• If str1 is rotation of str2 (or vice versa), return true. If not, return false.
• Keep in mind that you must control their lengths first.
• You can use any of the methods that you created in Question 3.
• You can modify your output based on Figure 4.
