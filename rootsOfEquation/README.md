6 (10 Pts.) Roots of an equation
• In this question, we will provide a equation which is 2x

2 + 4x − 6 = 0.
• As some of you may find out that the roots of this equation is 1 and -3.
• First, you need to find the delta of the equation, assign it to a variable.
• Second, you need declare two different variables as firstRoot and secondRoot, find and
assign the roots using the formula: −b ±√delta
2a
assuming you already know how to find the

delta regarding previous homeworks.
• You can use Math.Sqrt function to take square root of delta. You can see the usage of
Math.Sqrt function in Figure 6.1.
• After you find out the roots, you will create a loop and generate two different random
numbers between (0 - 10) and (-10 – 0). If these two random numbers happen to be the
root of this equation (1 and -3), you will stop the loop.
• Print out all random numbers until you hit the correct roots.
• You can modify your output as it is shown in Figure 6.
