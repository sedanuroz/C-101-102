In this question, you are asked to create string related methods.
• Method signatures are given below:
o static string ConvertToLowercase(string str)
o static string ConvertToUppercase(string str)
o static bool IsEqual(string str1, string str2)
o static char SecondMostFrequentLetter(string str)
o static bool IsContain(string str1, string str2)
• ConvertToLowercase() method takes a string, converts all of its letters (characters) to
lowercase letters and returns the converted string. You must iterate through each character
to complete this method. You cannot use any predefined methods.
• ConvertToUppercase() method takes a string parameter, converts all of its letters
(characters) to uppercase letters and returns the converted string. You must iterate through
each character to complete this method. You cannot use any predefined methods.
• IsEqual() method takes two string parameters and checks if the strings are equal. If the
strings are equal, return true. If not, return false. You must check the strings character by
character. Obviously, if the lengths of the strings are not equal, you must return false.

Figure 2

• SecondMostFrequentLetter() method takes a string parameter and returns the second most
frequent character. Acknowledge that there is only one letter as second most frequent
character. Do not think what happens if there were two frequent letters.
• IsContain() method takes two string parameters and returns true if str2 takes place
somewhere in string1. If not, return false.
• You cannot use any helper methods.
• As we did not state in this question, do not take inputs from user. You can pass necessary
parameters to your methods manually.
• You can modify your output based on Figure 3.
