6 (20 Pts.) Online Shopping
• Suppose there is an online shopping website that only sells computers. Brands, IDs and
the prices of the computers are given in Table 3.
• Before start shopping, the user asked to enter a password which can be at least 4 and at
most 6 digits. If the password is invalid, your program should prompt an error.
• If user can enter an appropriate password, then your program should ask for an input to
indicate either computer brand or ID of a computer.
• If the brand name or ID of a computer does not match with the values on Table 3, you
should print an error message.
• Before you calculate the price, your program should ask the user if the user is student or
not.
• For the student question, Y indicates Yes and N indicates No.

• If the user is a student, you should calculate the price with a 20% discount.
