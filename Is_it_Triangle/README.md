For this question, you will take 6 inputs from user to indicate the sides and angles of a
triangle.
• First, you will take the sides of the triangle, then you will take the angles of the triangle.
• While programming, you will check the sides first as we did in the laboratory.
• If the sides can create a triangle, you will check if angles are met the conditions.
• All angles should be greater than 0 and the sum of the angles should be 180.
• Note: You will not check the relationship between the sides and the angles.
• After all conditions are met, you are going to check if given triangle is equilateral, scalene
or isosceles triangle.
• While checking if this triangle is equilateral, scalene or isosceles triangle, you will only
consider its sides, not its angles.
