• For this question, you are asked to multiply two matrices.
• Search on the internet or use your own knowledge to figure out how to multiply two
matrices.
• We will provide you two different set of matrices, but you can try different inputs too.
• We may try different matrices at different sizes to test your code. Hence, you need to
create a general code that can work on any matrices.
• First, create matrices that we provided in Figure 1 in your code and do the calculation
using these matrices.
• You can modify your output based on Figure 1.
